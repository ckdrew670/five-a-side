## Five-A-Side Team Picker

This app, created using React, allows the user to type in multiple player names to be randomly sorted into two teams. 


## How it works

The user enters each player name. The names are stored in an array that is outputted as an unordered list below the form input. 
The user then clicks on 'Create Teams' which randomly shuffles the array of names, hides the form and initial list and displays the team sheets. Each team card currently uses a .filter() iterator method (taking the index value and seeing if it is odd or even) to split the names into the two teams. 
In the team sheets view, the user can choose to Reshuffle the teams (calling the shuffleArray() method again) or can be taken back to the previous view to create a brand new team.

Improvements:
Allow the user to change the list before the teams are split. 
Allow user to input player ability and sort teams accordingly.

## Method

Initially, I created a React app using one main component (Settings.js - there is also a Header.js) so that I could get the app working without worrying about lifting state/Redux. 

Next step: split app into appropriate components and add Redux to manage state. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
